# Lead, Manager, & Director Roles

## Leads

Includes all the technical roles & responsibilities at their base level.

They will have a small team of data scientists and data engineers reporting to them.

They are responsible for providing project guidance, mentorship, and coaching their direct reports.

They spend at least half their time on Data Science work.

They are not involved in compensation & leveling review.


## Data Science Managers

Similar to an Engineering Manager, but has strong data science skills rather than engineering skills.

They spend most of their time setting priorities, roadmaps, working with product management, and, career development of their reports.

They handle compensation & leveling reviews.


## Directors of Data Science

Handles multiple teams, most of which will be data focussed.

Owns a budget.

Possibly little or no distinction to a Director of Engineering.
